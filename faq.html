        <h1 class="faq-title fade-in">About Barter</h1>
        <p class="intro-text fade-in">
            Barter is the world’s first mainstream cryptocurrency-powered marketplace. Our mission is simple: give people the freedom to buy & sell online — safely, anonymously, and without restrictions.
        </p>

        <h2 class="faq-subheading fade-in">Our Vision</h2>
        <p class="fade-in">
            We believe in decentralization. Barter is designed for the people — no ID, no banks, and no invasive tracking. Whether you’re buying a digital or physical product we want your experience to be seamless, private, and borderless.
        </p>

        <h2 class="faq-subheading fade-in">How Does It Work?</h2>
        <ul class="faq-list fade-in">
            <li><strong>Crypto-Powered:</strong> We support all major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Pi. Use a third party crypto wallet (i.e. Coinbase) to load your account balance or pay for orders.</li>
            <li><strong>Built-in Escrow:</strong> Funds are held securely until both buyer and seller complete the trade.</li>
            <li><strong>Anonymous:</strong> No identity verification, no credit cards, no problem.</li>
            <li><strong>Decentralized:</strong> We're working toward decentralized hosting and smart contract-based trade processing in future updates.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="fade-in">Our purpose is to provide the ability to list digital or physical products for sale, choose your preferred crypto to obtain, and receive your coin of choice from us—even if the buyer pays with a different coin. We charge a small seller's fee of 8% (6% for early-access users). Use a third party wallet (i.e. Coinbase) to load account balance or directly pay for orders. Together, we can create the world's first community of buyers and sellers that revolves around the crypto world.</p>
